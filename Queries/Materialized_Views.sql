-- 1) Daily revenue (orders are 1 row per order in dw.fact_order)
drop materialized view if exists dw.mv_daily_revenue;

create materialized view dw.mv_daily_revenue as

-- 2) Product sales (include labels from dim_product)
drop materialized view if exists dw.mv_product_sales;

create materialized view dw.mv_product_sales as

-- 3) Customer lifecycle (order grain â†’ count(*) is order count)
drop materialized view if exists dw.mv_customer_lifecycle;
